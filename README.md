# Walmart-Labs
#Used Modern app architecture MVVM which is a suite of libraries to help me with app development and reduce boilerplate code.
#View Model is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way and Repository to send or receive data from local and remote data source.
#Used LiveData because it is an observable data holder class has lifecycle aware.
#Used Room database for caching images and Anime objects if there are no internet connection, it saves my time from writing a lot of boilerplate code to create and manage databases.
#Used Picasso library for uploading image from URL.
#Implemented Junit4 testing for write and read from room database.
#Implemented search and retrieve data using Retrofit library.
#Used Coroutines to manage threading and concurrency in database and network access.
